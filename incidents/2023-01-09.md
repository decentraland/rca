## What happened?

Some users were experiencing logging in and being introduced again to the avatar creation screen. Their profiles were not being correctly obtained.

## Why did it happen?

A change introduced an error parsing the users ID which meant that the users profile was not obtained correctly.

## Issue Timeline

1. Issue was reported on the crash channel and the investigation began by Juan & Mateo.
2. After some discussion with the Platforms team it was determined it was not a catalyst issue. 
3. It was discovered a change on Oct, 28th, 2022 introduced the issue into the Kernel. https://github.com/decentraland/kernel/pull/642
4. The issue was rectified within the Kernel repository after some investigation by fixing the erroneous backend invocation.

## Impact

Some users were not able to access their avatars and were forced into a new avatar creation mode. 

## Solution

We have introduced a fix to the kernel to ensure the user was able to retrieve the correct profile. We are looking to introduce full QA testing process
for the kernel rollout process which should prevent such issues moving forward.

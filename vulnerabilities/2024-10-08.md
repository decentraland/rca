## Description

During the Archipelago handshake, the client was signing any message received from the comms adapter. This vulnerability allowed attackers to craft a signed message and use it to construct a signedFetch, which could then be sent to a different service. Exploiting this flaw, malicious actors could create phishing realm with a custom WebSocket server to make arbitrary signedFetch requests on behalf of the user.

## Severity

Websites & Applications - High.

## Solution

The message sent by Archipelago followed a pre-established format, starting with "dcl-" followed by an alphanumeric string. To address the vulnerability, a validation was introduced on the client-side. Now, during the handshake, only messages conforming to this format can be signed. Any message that doesn't meet this format will be rejected, preventing unauthorized signing. Additionally, messages signed with the Archipelago format will not be accepted for any other signedFetch requests, effectively fixing the vulnerability.

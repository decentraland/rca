## What happened?

Users were not seeing the execution of custom emotes between each other. They worked locally but not through the network

## Why did it happen?

The expressionTriggerTimestamp, a variable necessary for the execution of the emote accross the network, was ntot being set correctly by the sender of the emote. This was due to a type mismatch for emote message and the value being set.

## Issue Timeline

1. Issue was reported in the #crash channel.
2. The issue was detected and a hotfix was released the same day.

## Impact

Users did not see the execution of the custom emotes between each other.

## Solution

The type mismatch was corrected. An auto-incrementing int counter is now being used as expressionTriggerTimestamp to send the timestamp across the network.

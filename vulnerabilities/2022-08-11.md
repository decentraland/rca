## Description

The vulnerability allowed any authenticated user to delete any unpublished item (wearable) in the builder by providing an item id.

The vulnerability was categorized as low due to:

- The difficulty of getting an ID that could be deleted of another user.
- The low impact that deleting an unpublished item has, as items that are not published are items that are being worked on and the creator can simply re-create the items.

The issue occurred due to a bug in the check to verify that the user deleting the item is the owner of the item, where a variable was compared against itself, being always true thus allowing anyone to delete an item.

## Severity

Websites & Applications - Low

## Solution

The comparison check was changed to verify the address correctly. The fix can be found [here](https://github.com/decentraland/builder-server/pull/579)

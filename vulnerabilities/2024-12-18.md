## Description

The server allowed the submission of any URL for an image. Therefore, an attacker can get the public IP address if the image URL is a webhook.

## Severity

Websites & Applications - Medium.

## Solution

We have implemented a [URL check](https://github.com/decentraland/governance/commit/32a9e34eba4aebf8426f7f8902bee92e5ff69782) on all images for proposal markdown fields to prevent it, and added a list of [Trusted Domains](https://github.com/decentraland/governance/commit/e9d602fd7a0a1e83f61a30e241911c2b16fce740).

## Description

The builder server stores content in AWS S3 buckets. It uses these for things ranging from assets for scenes to wearables. To store this data without having clashes or naming problems, it uses a CID or content ID. This content id depends on the content being uploaded, meaning that if you change anything about an asset, for example, it'll result in a different hash (similar to how SHA256 works for example). Because of how the explorer accesses this content to render it, we save it in a flat directory structure. This means that all content for all users lives in the same content folder.

The problem was that, even though we checked wallet permissions and ownership of the asset/wearable being uploaded, we left the responsibility of generating this CID to the front-end. This means that anyone could upload content and change the CID for it, replacing the content for other people’s scenes or wearables.

## Severity

Websites & Applications- High.

## Solution

To fix it, we moved the CID generation to the server, so now no matter what you upload it’ll end up with the correct id and you won’t be able to override other people’s content. The PR that fixes this can be found [here](https://github.com/decentraland/builder-server/pull/569).

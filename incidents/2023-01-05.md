## What happened?

After a new release of unity-renderer occurred a manual rollout of an invalid version was attempted which didn't exist. The launcher was unable to download
the non-existing version and thus did not launch.

## Why did it happen?

An invalid renderer version was supplied, with no validation in place it attempted to download a version that did not exist. 

## Impact

All desktop users could not launch the Decentraland for a short period of time.

## Solution 

We have a number of solutions which are being worked on internally, these include:

- Validation of the release commit hash.
- Merge of the desktop and unity-renderer repositories.
- Automation of the desktop release process.

## What happened?

The realms using Comms v2 were not showing the info of other realms and hot-scenes that were using Comms v3. 

## Why did it happen?

Some Catalyst nodes were upgraded to use the new version of the Comms service that leverages LiveKit Cloud to provide high speed and quality communications between users. This version expose the realm and hot-scenes information with some small differences and the v2 version had to be updated to consume it.


## Issue Timeline

1. 2022-12-06 Comms v3 rollout to the Foundation Catalysts nodes 
2. 2022-12-07 07:00 Issue reported 
3. 2022-12-07 17:00 Patch provided for catalyst owners running v2

## Impact

Users log into the Catalyst nodes running Comms v2 were not able to view the list of realms and users count of the nodes running v3. They were still able to log-in or change realm using the URL or the commands. 

## Solution

A patch version for the v2 version was created to consume the right information and avoid rushing the rollout of v3 that is still under an evaluation period.

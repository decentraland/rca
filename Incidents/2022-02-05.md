## What happened?
Some users reported that wearables were not loading on their backpack

## Why did it happen?
A wearable was deployed and airdropped with an inconsistent structure, this was possible either from an issue in the Builder Server/UI or a script that manually created the deployment of the asset.

## Issue Timeline

- Feb-08-2022 User confirmed that the issue started after an event airdrop with the following Collections: [The Wonderquest Ram Skull
](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x6da5a89ce1f9af2f60ebfbce0825ff958872acce/315936875005671560093754083051011296956685286201647333762932932667) and [The Wonderquest Mask](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x6da5a89ce1f9af2f60ebfbce0825ff958872acce/59)
- Feb-8-2022 The lambda with the Collection confirmed the missing field https://peer.decentraland.org/lambdas/collections/wearables?wearableId=urn:decentraland:matic:collections-v2:0x6da5a89ce1f9af2f60ebfbce0825ff958872acce:3
- Feb-08-2022 Added validations on the catalyst deployment https://github.com/decentraland/content-validator/pull/27 to prevent corrupted representations
- Feb-09-2022 Filter corrupted collections from the Kernel to avoid the crash and log the error https://github.com/decentraland/kernel/pull/191 
- Feb-09-2022 Asked the content Creator to republish the collection
- Feb-10-2022 Prevent uploading broken representations from the Builder
https://github.com/decentraland/builder-server/commit/efc7b3179bdaa5a178b2bc4bc94443f53718a63d

## Impact 

During 5 days a set of users were not able to load any of their wearables
## Solution 

Given the current wearable representation, the Builder Server validated that the structure before doing a deployment. Now Catalyst also validates the files that are part of the representation are present on the deployment and the Kernel filters corrupted Collections and gracefully logs the error. 
On April 1st, 2022 the Catalyst Servers will also start to run entities [schemas validations](https://github.com/decentraland/adr/blob/main/docs/ADR-45-entities-v4.md) helping to prevent more corrupted deployments.

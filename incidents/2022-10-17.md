## What happened?

After release `1.0.57934-20221013161320.commit-72f1dfe` we have started to receive reports from content creators about 3D models not render in their scenes. They would work well in preview, but not in production environment.
The issue was not reproducible 100%.
Models have been interactable, but mesh was not rendered and not visible to the users.

## Why did it happen?

- In the `1.0.57934-20221013161320.commit-72f1dfe` we have introduced performance improvements to the Culling Controller that created the issue under specific circumstance.

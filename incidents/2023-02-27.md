## What happened?

Friend Requests, list all friends and private chat weren't being shown in the UI.

## Why did it happen?

All the requests to the Social Service were correctly done and receive, but the Explorer to show the information of other users needs to load their profiles from the Kernel side. So the badge notification of new friend requests appeared, but then the list was empty.

A refactor of the way that profiles are retrieved in the Kernel side was done that introduced this issue.

## Issue Timeline

- February 10, 2023: The refactor of get profiles was merged https://github.com/decentraland/unity-renderer/pull/4312
- February 14, 2023: A new version of the Explorer was released that include that change (`1.0.82987-20230216163357.commit-86cbefe`)
- February 27, 2023: The issue was reporter by a user
- February 27, 2023: Rollback of the Explorer version to `1.0.80433-20230210163215.commit-bc9219c`

## Impact

All users couldn't access to their friends list, their private chats and they couldn't manage friendships requests.

## Solution

Fix the bug of get profiles https://github.com/decentraland/unity-renderer/pull/4465

## Description

A link to sites hosted as Cloudflare Pages that used the Facebook pixel could be crafted so the `:javascript` string ended up being used as a cookie, which upon being sent to any of our sites, resulted in the user being blocked by Cloudflare's WAF.

We've identified this as a Cloudflare bug, as there's an inconsistency between how the WAF rules are applied to query string and cookies, where the string `:javascript` was not blocked when used as a query string but gets blocked when used as cookie.

Users that opened these types of links would have required to clear the site's cookies in order to remove the block.

## Severity

Websites & Applications - Low.

## Solution

We've implemented a WAF rule to prevent any requests from containing a query parameter with `:javascript` in them.

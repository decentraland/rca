## What happened?

Some Catalyst nodes reported incorrect metrics for online users, even with negative numbers, affecting the metric in the Decentraland Status Page at https://status.decentraland.org/

## Why did it happen?

Some of the Catalyst nodes were updated to run communications service over LiveKit, with that update the way that the online users were counted changed to be a calculation between the new and finished connections to the Back end for Front End service, there was a problem in that calculation that caused the wrong numbers.

## Impact

During the time of the incident (Dec 7th to Dec9th) the online users metric in the status page exposed lower and incorrect statistics. 

## Solution 

Instead of doing calculations between the connections the service was patch to observe and count the number of connections, which is equivalent to the number of users connected to the server

# NFT Emotes RCA

# **2022/09/01**

## **What happened?**

New NFT Emotes flow release caused two issues.

(2022-09-01 - ***SEV1***): Users unable to save their profiles due to a new `renderer`.

(2022-09-06 - ***SEV3***): Users unable to see other peers emotes.

## **Why did it happen?**

A misunderstanding between `renderer` and `kernel` caused a discordance between the avatar payload sent by `renderer` and the one accepted by `kernel`. This change: https://github.com/decentraland/kernel/pull/393/commits/0d6f012afaecaf2625d91e0ff63988904a1861e0 was in the wrong branch. It was supposed to be released independently before the `renderer` release but it was included in the one kicking-off NFT Emotes.

After the rollback and further fixes, a new `kernel` release caused users to stop seeing other peers emotes. This was fixed promptly for the old emotes flow and also for the new ones before the full launch of NFT Emotes.

- 2022-09-09 19:24: when testing the catalysts before the migration a new issue was spotted, emotes were working locally but were not visible to other peers.

- 2022-09-09 20:54:  `[kernel release {1.0.0-3025255753.commit-30002bc}](https://github.com/decentraland/kernel/actions/runs/3025283875/jobs/4867578356)`  solved emotes in other peers for old NFT emotes flow ([PR](https://github.com/decentraland/kernel/pull/492)).
- ✅ All systems are now working correctly.
- 2022-09-14 15:18: `[kernel release {1.0.0-3053947166.commit-0446c77}](https://github.com/decentraland/kernel/actions/runs/3053987297/jobs/4925315189)` solved emotes in other peers for new NFT emotes flow ([PR](https://github.com/decentraland/kernel/pull/507)).

## **Impact**

***(SEV1)*:** Users couldnt save their avatar (100% repro rate) when using the `renderer: {1.0.51910-20220901164430.commit-1e215aa}`. Some scenes require certain assets to be equipped to assist events. 
The feature was broken for a total of 9 hours, once it was reported it was fixed in less than 15 minutes.

**(SEV3):** Users couldnt see other peers emotes (100% repro rate) when using *`kernel:* {1.0.0-3002225086.commit-aca9674}` in conjuction with *`unity renderer:* {1.0.52683-20220908150255.commit-711fb87}`. 
The total downtime of the feature was 90 minutes since it was found by us.

## **Solution**

Rolling back the problematic renderer release solved issues for users in production. 

Later a kernel release introduced a small issue that caused other peers to not reproduce emotes. A quick hotfix hit production within 4 hours solving the issue for all the old NFT Emotes flow.

Overall the total “downtime” for the emotes feature not working as expected was around 11 hours. 7 hours not being able to save your user profile (**SEV1**) + 4 hours not being able to see other peers emotes (**SEV3**).

## Description

There is no invalid image filter in the image_previews parameter of the linked wearables proposals on the back end, causing hackers to insert webhook links and leak other users' IP addresses and user agents.

## Severity

Websites & Applications - Medium.

## Solution

We have disabled the submission of linked wearables proposals, since they are not needed anymore.

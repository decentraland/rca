## Description

The loadbalancer from our business environment and one of our S3 buckets were allowing traffic to come from any AWS IP addresses. The websites behind that loadbalancer are supposed to be protected by Cloudflare, requiring login via Google or Github to access, bypassing Cloudflare meant the white hat hacker was able to bypass the login requirement and get access to our internal documentation and monitoring tools.

## Severity

Websites & Applications - High.

## Solution

We added rules to only allow Cloudflare IPs addresses to access our loadbalancer and allowing access to our S3 buckets only via CloudFront.

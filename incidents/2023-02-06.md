## What happened?

A programmed release of the new version of the Social Service which included improvements on the friendship management that implie a maintenance window for a few hours.

## Why did it happen?

Due to the upgrade of the Social Service to start handling friendhips and friend requests a migration was run in order to move all the content from the Matrix server to the new service DB, window during which modifications to this state could not be made to ensure consistency between the two systems.

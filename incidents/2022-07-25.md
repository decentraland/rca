## What happened?

Cloudflare XSS protection prevented some users to deploy scenes or wearables

## Why did it happen?

Some deploys that includes Javascript files where detected by Cloudflare as an XSS attack

## Issue Timeline

July-25-2022 13:50 XSS protection was enabled on Cloudflare

July-25-2022 16:30 Users reported a CORS error when they tried to deploy an scene

July-25-2022 19:46 We disabled a rule `100135B: XSS - JavaScript Events` on Cloudflare WAF and wrote those instructions on playbooks as a future reference

July-27-2022 13:57 Users reported an error when they tried to deploy smart wearables

July-27-2022 14:25 We disabled a rule `100026: PHP, vBulletin, jQuery File Upload - Code Injection, Dangerous File Upload` on Cloudflare WAF and wrote those instructions on playbooks as a future reference

## Impact

Some users were unable to deploy scenes or smart wearables, the exact amount are limited to those with files that match the cloudflare protection rules

## Solution

Disable rules in cloudflare that prevent sending javascript in a request

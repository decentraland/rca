## Description

Allows a Collaborator to effectively strip the Owner of all control over the campaign, including managing supply, dispensers, transactions, and other users.

Malicious Collaborators could exploit this to hijack campaigns, steal rewards, or disrupt operations.

## Severity

Websites & Applications - Low.

## Solution

It was a missing check in the ownership action that can only prevent a temporary login.

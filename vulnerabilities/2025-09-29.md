## Description

The Admin Tools UI was being synced between all parties and therefore the keys for streaming were distributed between all the participants of the scene.

## Severity

Websites & Applications - Critical.

## Solution

[Stop setting the streaming key in the VideoControl component](https://github.com/decentraland/asset-packs/commit/5d0a533a2fa5033e72103a10b9eebd26b4dd13ba) and add more UI cosmetic improvements to hide the key more often.

## What happened?

Gabriel Diaz from the Dapps team noticed and reported that the Transak widget to buy MANA was not working.

## Why did it happen?

From what the Transak team reported back, the ARS currency was disabled to buy MANA on their systems, but the widget was not handling the case of a currency being disabled and was blowing up instead of showing that this use case was not supported. Users from outside of Argentina did not experience this issue.

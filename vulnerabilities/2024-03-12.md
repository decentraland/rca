## Description

The event server allowed the submission of any URL for event images. Therefore, an attacker can get the public IP address if the image URL is a webhook.

## Severity

Websites & Applications - Low.

## Solution

We have implemented a [URL check](https://github.com/decentraland/events/commit/d9e16875283a9325075d9a6d5fa306ee766f0ffc) to prevent it.

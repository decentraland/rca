| **Reported on**            | August-18-2022 |
| **Mitigation**             | August-18-2022 |
| **Solution Completed**     | TBD |
| **Severity**               | SEV-2        |

## What happened?

After updating all peers from Catalyst `v4.9.0` to `v4.11.0` the node `peer-eu1.decentraland.org` started to throw CPU alarms and the Lambdas Service started returning too many 502 status code on the endpoints `/lambdas/profiles` and `/lambdas/explore/hot-scenes`. 
That made that for every person which was geographically near of Europe, the scenes didn't load as the load balancer selected `peer-eu1.decentraland.org`

## Why did it happen?

- The load balancer `peer.decentraland.org` and `peer-lb.decentraland.org` routed traffic to `peer-eu1.decentraland.org` even when it was returning too many 502 status code, as the endpoint /about shown an ok response of its health.

## Issue Timeline

1. Some users reported that they weren't able to teleport
2. Users reported getting stuck at 94% of downloading images, 3d models and sounds
3. The issue could be replicated in every realm with people located in Europe
4. Increase in % 502 errors in HTTP `peer-eu1.decentraland.org`
5. Restarted peer-eu1 as it has a CPU and database queries issue
6. Everything back to normal
   
## Impact

All European users were not able to download scenes and their assets.

## Solution

[] The LoadBalancer should penalize the services that are returning too many 5xx responses
[] Add the CPU health status in `/health` catalysts' endpoint

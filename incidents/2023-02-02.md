## What happened?

Sergey D. reported us that he was not able to do any teleport because the application always got freezed.

## Why did it happen?

We noticed that we were provoking a null reference exception in the `SceneBoundsFeedbackStyle_RedBox` class (belonging to our Unity project) when we were using the `DEBUG_MODE` url param and we tried to do a teleport.

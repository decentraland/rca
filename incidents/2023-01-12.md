## What happened?

Users started reporting that they were not able to list their friends in-world or send friend requests to other players.

## Why did it happen?

While working on a new solution for friend management in world, the existing solution, i.e. Matrix, and the new Social Service coexist, routing half of user population to each of them for testing purposes. A change was introduced in how we were computing the user ids in the new service which was not compatible with Matrix's format and given that the clients were assuming this, half of the connected users were getting errors when trying to connect to the service for listing their friends or sending friend requests.

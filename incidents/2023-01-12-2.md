## What happened?

Users where not able to login into DG realm

## Why did it happen?

Comms service at DG was not working and the client kept retrying connecting to the same node. 

## Issue Timeline

DG had the highest amount of users connected so new users entering the platform where directed to this server by the client catalyst scoring logic. The comms LiveKit node at DG was having problems and not letting new users in and the client kept retrying to connect to the same node. After the issue was noticed, the DG realm was temporary ignored by the client, letting users login into the platform. 
After the DG LiveKit node was restarted, all went back to normal. In order to avoid this issue in the future a maxRetry property was implemented in the Kernel so that if the connection to the comms service fails x amount of times then try with a different node from the Catalyst Network. 


## Impact

During the time of the incident, users where not able to join DG realm. 

## Solution

Avoid keep retrying connecting to the same realm if the comms service is failing:

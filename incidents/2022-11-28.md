## What happened?

The scenes SDK6 MessageBus wasn't working correctly in production but worked fine in preview mode (locally-run scene) and the scene messages only get received by the same sender client, not the rest of the clients.

## Why did it happen?

The problem was introduced with a big Kernel refactor.

## Issue Timeline

1. 2022-10-27 The problem was reported in Discord by a creator, it wasn't prioritized right away as at first it seemed like a problem in their scene only.
2. 2022-11-28 After getting new and frequent reports of the problem by other creators the crash incident was created. 
3. 2022-11-28 The problem was debugged using test scenes and found [the commit](https://github.com/decentraland/kernel/commit/f2c627daea25fc9c01ffd7ec6b58d69fd035e0db) that introduced the issue.
4. 2022-11-29 A [fix commit](https://github.com/decentraland/kernel/commit/baa9792044aa7c3aa662cefb5400233b7cad2e5c) was introduced and released to fix the issue.

## Impact

The issue affected every SDK6 scene using the scene's MessageBus in production, although having the problem for 1 month only 3 different creators reported de problem.

## Solution

A missing check on the client's comms island used was implemented to fix the transport flow of the messagebus messages.

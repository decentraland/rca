## What happened?

We noticed a larger than normal amount of crashes on the windows version of the build. We immediately began to investigate the issue and verify reports from active users. It was found that this only occurs on application exit.

## Why did it happen?

The shutdown process within the unity renderer isn't exiting cleanly and thus crashes in the native code environment.

## Impact

The impact was very minimal to the end user since this only occurs on exit and is not noticeable to the end user in most cases, and it is not happening during the experience as such we decided to close the SEV-3 issue for now.

## Solution

The solution is now ongoing - we are working with Unity support on why this is happening and will be attempting fixes over the following weeks.

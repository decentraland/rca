## What happened?

Goerli network cannot be logged into on any platform or login type. For both wallet and guest loading takes to an avatar creation screen with no avatar preview and wearables available and clicking Done doesn't progress further. Issue occurs for normal login into Goerli as well as when using the Builder.

## Why did it happen?

When using the Goerli network, Explorer tries to connect with Catalysts in .zone (generally dev/testing environment) as opposed to the production ones provided for Mainnet. The default realm for this environment is artemis (peer.decentraland.zone) which was failing in its reponses to the client, generating the above mentioned situation and blocking the user experience.

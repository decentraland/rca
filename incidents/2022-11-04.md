## What happened?

After a few release of unity-renderer we started to receive more and more reposrt about 3d models appearing on wrong scenes.

## Why did it happen?

Some scense that were deployed when having any exception with loading would stop thw message queue system to work and at the same process any new messages to render world properly

## Impact

Some users would not see all models renedere when entering specific scenes.

## Solution 

We have applied fix https://github.com/decentraland/unity-renderer/pull/3423 which was relesed in next release

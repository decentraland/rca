## Description

Deprecated AWS Dev account's credentials were exposed in old commits, which allow attackers to get control over an old AWS account: read S3 buckets content, create or terminate EC2 instances, access to secrets, etc.
## Severity

Websites & Applications - Low.

## Solution

We have disabled the credentiales leaked and the remaining non-leaked credentials in that AWS dev account.

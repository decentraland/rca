## Description

When doing an HTTP request to a Cloudflare Page asset that can be cached by Cloudflare, if the request contains an amount of headers bigger than what Cloudflare is willing to process with a WAF blocked header as the last of them, Cloudflare returned the classic WAF blocked page and cached it for 15 seconds. This cached page is seen by everyone that connects to the node until the cache expires.

We've identified this as a Cloudflare bug, as this is exploitable under the default Cloudflare Page + WAF configuration.

The bug is exploitable only in nodes that don't have the exploited HTTP request cached or in which the cache is expired and would require a coordinated attack of bots connected in different regions.

## Severity

Websites & Applications - Low.

## Solution

We've implemented a WAF rule to prevent any request with a big amount of headers.

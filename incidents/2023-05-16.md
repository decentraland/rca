## What happened?

Places API returned a timeout error when a user tried to get places

## Why did it happen?

Due to an increase in the number of places (thanks to an update that indexes all places in real-time) and the use of Explorer's places API, the Postgres query planner ignored the places_by_position index, causing queries to take more time than the requests received which increase the time even more and finally, they took more than Cloudflare's timeout

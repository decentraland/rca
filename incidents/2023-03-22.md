## What happened?

Some users with a claimed name will not display properly in world. Their name will appear as a guest name & #xxxx.

## Why did it happen?

The issue seemed to be originated by an inconsistency reconciliatin remote profile versions with the locally stored cache, unchecking the claim mark in the profile metadata and thus adding the unclaimed name suffix to the publicly visible avatar.

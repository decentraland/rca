## What happened?

Users started reporting that they were not able to list their friends in-world or send friend requests to other players.

## Why did it happen?

While working on a new solution for friend management in world, the existing solution, i.e. Matrix, and the new Social Service coexist, routing half of user population to each of them. A change was introduced in how we were computing the user ids in the new service which was not compatible with Matrix's format and given that the clients were assuming this, half of the connected users were getting errors when trying to connect to the service for listing their friends or sending friend requests.

1. 2023-01-12 22:33 Confirmed cause of the issue and mitigation success

## Impact

Half of the users connected at the moment where not able to list their friends in-world or send/respond to friend requests.

## Solution

The default limit of 100kb in the Content Server for the size of the payloads in the requests was increased to 1mb.

Note: as the users get more and more wearables, eventually the request size will go over 1mb. It can then increased again. But another solutions need to be considered, as pagination which is something not trivial for this case.

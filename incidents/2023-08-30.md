## What happened?

Users reported that they were not able use authenticated endpoint on Governance, with the error: `Missing identity to sign the request`

## Why did it happen?

The new authentication service (Single Sign On) we use to store user identities was not checking for expiration, causing services to ignore the identity to sign requests or signing requests with expired identities (depending on the implementation) sometime after the first login.

## Issue Timeline - UTC

1. 2023-08-29 20:00 We received a report from our developers in the Governance Team that some of the devs were not able to use some of the service that requires authentication.
2. 2023-08-30 14:38 A working group was created to investigate the issue, and identify the problem as the Single Sign On service not checking for expiration.
3. 2023-08-30 16:41 The issue was addressed and the fix was deployed to staging to test it.
4. 2023-08-30 16:47 The fix was deployed to production and the issue was solved.

## Impact

Users were not able to use authenticated endpoint on any dApp other than the Explorer

## Solution

Checked if the stored Session on the Single Sign On was expired, and if it was expired, regenerated.

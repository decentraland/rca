## What happened?

NFTs with animated gif thumbnails have stopped showing thumbnails

https://github.com/decentraland/unity-renderer/issues/3492

## Why did it happen?

Now opensea resolves the animated NFTs with WEBP files instead of GIF, this breaks all the thumbnail with Animated NFTs.

## Impact

Most animated images wheren't loading.

## Mitigation

Open sea left a query param to load animated images as gifs.

We added a fallback system so when we request an animated image that comes as WEBP format, we load it as a GIF

## Solution

For a proper solution we have to give the platform proper WEBP support, the issue was added to the backlog and will be adressed in the future

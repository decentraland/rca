## Description

Behind the scenes of the recently released collection publication fee pegged to the US dollar update, we are using Chainlink to obtain the price a creator has to pay.

Chainlink allows us to consume validated off-chain data (in this case currency rates) inside our smart contracts.

This way, we can charge the equivalent of 150 dollars per item in MANA to creators when they send the transaction to publish a collection.

How this is achieved by Chainlink is by having a pool of Oracles submitting the MANA/USD rate to the blockchain in a timely manner and an aggregator that validates and ultimately defines the rate that will be consumed by the end user (in this case out contracts)

However, if not enough oracles publish the rate for a given round, the latest price will be used and might be a problem if this lack of consensus or delay happens for a long time.

For example, if the price was not updated for a long time and the aggregator returns that MANA costs 1 USD but in reality, it costs 2 USD, creators would end up paying double what they should really be paying to publish a collections.

## Severity

Smart Contracts - Low.

## Solution

We added a rule where if the price was not updated in the last hour (an arbitrary amount of time which we believe is a tolerable delay), it would revert and prevent publications.
